## Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each type of component:
```
Electronics Diagnostic Lab/
├── Displays/
├── Sensors/
├── LEDs_and_Matrices/
├── Communication_Modules/
└── Other_Components/
```
Each folder contains:
- **Test Scripts**: Code for automated and interactive tests.
- **Documentation**: Instructions and details about the tests.
- **Results** (optional): Sample test results or logs.
